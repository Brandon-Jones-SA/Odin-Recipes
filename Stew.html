    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>1 cup red wine (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds</li>
      <li>3 potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, toss the beef cubes with flour, salt, and black pepper
        until the meat is evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high
        heat. Add the beef cubes and brown them on all sides. Work in batches if
        necessary to avoid overcrowding the pot. Once browned, remove the beef
        and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, add chopped onions and saut√© until they become
        translucent. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the beef broth and red wine (if using), scraping the bottom of
        the pot to release any browned bits. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme,
        rosemary, and bay leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the browned beef to the pot. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then
        reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours or
        until the beef is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the carrots, potatoes, and frozen peas to the pot. Simmer for an
        additional 30 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
        Remove the bay leaves before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the beef stew hot, ladled into bowls. Optionally, garnish with
        fresh chopped parsley for a burst of color and freshness.
      </li>
    </ol>
